RouteBy
===========

The route_by plugin allows you to use a field other than id to identify object
identities in your routes.

To install, simply run the following command from your project.

	script/plugin install git://github.com/gnoso/route_by.git

Then in your ActiveRecord model classes simply add the route_by statement.

Example
=======

class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  
	route_by :name
  
end

As a result of this statement, assuming your data has an id of 1 and
a :name attribute with the value "florida", your resourceful routes change from this:

  	http://server.com/models/1

to:

	http://server.com/models/florida

This is good for cases where you don't want your record ids in your Urls.
