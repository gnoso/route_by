= route_by

Route_By allows you to use a field other than ID for identifying object identities in your routes.

== Install
To install, simply run the following command from your project:

script/plugin install git://github.com/gnoso/route_by.git

== Usage
For your ActiveRecord model classes, simply add the route_by declaration:

<tt>
class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
	route_by :name
end
</tt>

As a result of this statement, assuming your Car object has an id of 114 and
a :name attribute with the value "eleanor", result this:

original:: http://server.com/cars/114
w/ route_by:: http://server.com/cars/eleanor
